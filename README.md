spring-groovymarkup
===================

Support classes to be able to use the Groovy MarkupTemplateEngine from Spring.

Spring Boot example
===================

An example of an application using the template engine with Spring Boot can be found in the ```example-boot``` directory.
You can run it directly by cloning this project then issuing the following command:


    ./gradlew run


It will start an application which listens on port 8080:

    * ```/``` is a page rendered using a markup template
    * ```/typechecked``` is a page rendered using a type checked markup template
